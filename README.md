# Ecosystem

My first attempt to create artificial life simulations. The "creatures" in this project have hard-coded behaviour and thus the only interesting part of the simulation is changing values in order to modify the evolutionary path, but eventually all creatures "max out" on speed and vision range in order to find food as quickly as possible. I plan on creating an RTNEAT based system in the future
